# Playback

The Playback part of the webarchive infrastructure is responsible for providing the archived websites to the reader or user.

In principle the playback part consists of an *Index* and *Playback Engine*.

Currently, *PyWB* with an *OutbackCDX* index as well as *SolrWayback* which is an index and playback in one are in the focus. But only *PyWB* is setup so far.
