# Playback

The Playback part of the webarchive infrastructure is responsible for providing the archived websites to the reader or user.

In principle the playback part consists of an *Index* and *Playback Engine*.

Currently, it is just a *PyWB*. With some init-containers before it, that need to be separated.
